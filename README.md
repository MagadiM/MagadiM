- 🌱 I’m an Entry Level Frontend Developer who uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am currently working on a few responsive website projects. My most recent project will be a personal portfolio which will showcase my skillset and abilities.

- 🌱 I am currently learning an advanced python course and working on both ReactJs and NodeJs libraries. I am working on the backend development aspects to enahnce skills. I started this journey learning about C programmig and Shell scripting and intend to explore more programming languages. My journey towards being a FullStack Developer has been intense and motivating. I have worked on various challenging tasks which have helped me understand my capabilities and also know how far I need to push to acheive my goals. 

Software engineering is just not a thing we do, its a life we live!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a responsive personal portfolio and an E-commerce site, in both Frontend and Backend.
