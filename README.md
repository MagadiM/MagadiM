- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS and MySQL programming languages. I started this journey learning about C programmig and Shell scripting. The journey towards being a FullStack Developer has been intense and motivating. I have worked on various challenging tasks which have helped me understand my capabilities and also know how far I need to push to acheive my goals. 

Software engineering is just not a thing we do, its a life we live!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ALX projects plus a few other personal projects that I hope will help me grow in the Development field. 
- :computer: I am looking forward to collaborating on projects with my peers in the near future.
